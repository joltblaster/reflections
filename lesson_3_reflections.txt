What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    It relies on the user to remember to commit their changes and it relies on
    the user to make a good judgement on when to save out and change do the 
    commit. I guess they are one and the same.
